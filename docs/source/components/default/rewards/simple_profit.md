# Simple Profit

A reward scheme that rewards the agent for profitable trades and prioritizes trading over not trading.

### Overview

The simple profit scheme needs to keep a history of profit over time. The way it does this is through looking at the portfolio as a means of keeping track of how the portfolio moves. This is seen inside of the `get_reward` function.
